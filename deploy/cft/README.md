# Cloud Foundation Toolkit Deployments

[Cloud Foundation Toolkit](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples/tree/master/community/cloud-foundation)
provides production-ready resource templates.

CFT Resources can be added by setting the `resources` field for a project in
the projects YAML file. Please check the documentation for a resource before
adding it in the project YAML config and stay up to date
with changes to this document as you sync the repo.

This feature is not currently ready for general use.
