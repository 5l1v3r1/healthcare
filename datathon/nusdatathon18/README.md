# Datathon Tutorials

Welcome to [NUS-NUH-MIT Datathon](http://www.nus-datathon.com/)!

We have prepared tutorials to get you started on [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), the tool to filter, join, aggregate and extract data from the raw datasets for analysis. In each of the tutorial, a couple of comprehensive examples are included to show how to view the datasets, run transformations and analyze them.

* For Python users, please start from the [Python colab](tutorials/bigquery_tutorial.ipynb), which is a Jupyter notebook hosted in Google Drive, and can be shared with other people for collaboration. It has the most comprehensive examples, including how to train machine learning models on the MIMIC demo dataset with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
* For people who has experience with R, checkout our [R tutorial](tutorials/bigquery_tutorial.Rmd), which provides an interactive interface to go through the tutorial in RStudio.
* If you are not familiar with either Python or R, take a look at [BigQuery web UI](tutorials/bigquery_ui.md), which requires no programming experience. With BigQuery web UI, aggregated data can be easily exported as CSV files and then processed by other tools.

Have fun!
